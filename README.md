# Algorithms-and-Complexity

## Scenario
Learning how to analyse an algorithm experimentally, by implementing it as an executable program, measuring the programâ€™s run-time characteristics, and aim is to directly compare two different algorithms that both perform the same function but may have different efficiencies. Ensuring that both programs are analysed under exactly the same conditions, to ensure that the results are meaningfully comparable. Also, counting the number of basic operations performed, measure execution times, and produce a clear report describing your findings.
